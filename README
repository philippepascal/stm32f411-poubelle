----------------------------------------------------------------
on the STM32F411 you have quite a few EXTI-capable pins, but only 16 interrupt lines (EXTI0–EXTI15).
Each line is shared across all GPIO ports (so PA0 and PB0 both map to EXTI0).
You can have up to 16 concurrent interrupts, one per EXTI line number.

You’re already using:
	•	PA7 → EXTI9_5 (lines 5–9 group)
	•	PA15 → EXTI15_10 (lines 10–15 group)

So lines 7 and 15 are taken.

You can safely add two more on any other unused EXTI line numbers (0–6, 8–14 except 7 and 15).
For example, on your STM32F411 “Black Pill” you might use:
Pin
EXTI Line
IRQ Vector
Notes
PA0     0   EXTI0   Currently used for DIR → not suitable unless re-routed
PA1     1   EXTI1   Currently used for STEP → not suitable
PA2     2   EXTI2   Free (good choice)
PA3     3   EXTI3   Free (good choice)
PA4     4   EXTI4   Free
PA5     5   EXTI9_5 Shares vector with PA7, but you can handle both in the same handler
PA8–PA9 8–9 EXTI9_5 Same group as PA7, shared vector
PA10–PA14   10–14   EXTI15_10   Shares vector with PA15

	If you want completely separate handlers (cleanest):
	•	PA2 → EXTI2 IRQ
	•	PA3 → EXTI3 IRQ
	•	If you don’t mind shared handlers (multiple pins per vector):
	•	You can use PA8 or PA9 (shared with PA7’s EXTI9_5).
	•	Or PA10–PA14 (shared with PA15’s EXTI15_10).

So for two more distinct interrupts, the simplest and least-conflicting choices are PA2 and PA3.
